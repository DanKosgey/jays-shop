2. Add proper form validation for all create/edit forms
3. Implement proper loading states for all async operations

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext)
- **Data Fetching**: Custom fetch utilities with caching

### Backend
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with custom policies
- **API**: Next.js API routes
- **Realtime**: Supabase Realtime (partially implemented)

### Database Schema
The project uses a comprehensive database schema with the following main tables:
- `profiles` - User profiles linked to auth.users

- `orders` - Customer orders
- `order_items` - Junction table for orders and products
- `customers` - Customer information

- `admin_logs` - Admin authentication logs

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
- Role-based access control (user/admin roles)
- Secure authentication with multiple providers
- Protected storage with bucket policies
- Account lockout mechanisms for failed login attempts

## Next Steps

1. Complete real-time updates implementation across all pages
2. Add comprehensive pagination and filtering
3. Implement proper data validation and error handling
4. Add audit logging for all admin actions
5. Optimize performance with caching strategies
6. Enhance security with additional measures

This project now has a solid foundation with all pages connected to the database and proper CRUD operations implemented. The remaining tasks focus on enhancing the user experience, improving performance, and adding advanced features.
