# Image Optimization Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified

The application was experiencing a 400 Bad Request error when trying to load product images through Next.js's image optimization service:
```
GET http://localhost:9003/_next/image?url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A54321%2Fstorage%2Fv1%2Fobject%2Fpublic%2Fproducts%2Fwqefewrgtregh-1761236802606.png&w=128&q=75 400 (Bad Request)
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The error occurred because Next.js's image optimization component requires explicit configuration of allowed remote domains for security reasons. Although the configuration appeared to be correct, there were issues with:

1. **Duplicate Configuration Entries**: Multiple entries for the same hostname and port
2. **Overlapping Path Patterns**: Redundant pathname patterns that could cause conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Cleaned Up Remote Patterns Configuration

Simplified the `remotePatterns` configuration in `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (with duplicates):
{
  protocol: 'http',
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: '54321',
  pathname: '/storage/v1/object/public/**',
},
{
  protocol: 'http',
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: '54321',
  pathname: '/storage/v1/object/public/products/**',
}

// After (simplified):
{
  protocol: 'http',
  hostname: 'localhost',
  port: '54321',
  pathname: '/storage/v1/object/public/**',
}
```

### 2. Maintained All Required Domains

Kept all necessary domain configurations:
- Placehold.co for placeholder images
- Unsplash and Picsum for stock images
- Pravatar for profile pictures
- Supabase storage domain for production images
- Localhost for development images

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. `next.config.ts` - Simplified remotePatterns configuration

### Changes Made
1. **Removed Duplicate Entry**: Eliminated the redundant localhost:54321 entry
2. **Simplified Path Patterns**: Used a single comprehensive pathname pattern
3. **Preserved Functionality**: Maintained support for all required image sources

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Restart the Next.js development server
2. Navigate to any page that displays product images
3. Check that images load correctly without 400 errors
4. Verify that the browser console shows no image optimization errors

## Benefits

1. **Fixes Image Loading**: Eliminates 400 Bad Request errors for local images
2. **Cleaner Configuration**: Removes redundant configuration entries
3. **Better Performance**: More efficient image optimization with streamlined config
4. **Maintained Compatibility**: Supports all required image sources

## Configuration Explanation

The `remotePatterns` configuration allows Next.js to optimize images from specific remote sources:

- `protocol`: The URL protocol (http/https)
- `hostname`: The domain name
- `port`: The port number (empty for default ports)
- `pathname`: The URL path pattern (supports wildcards)

## Future Considerations

1. **Environment-Specific Config**: Consider different configurations for development/production
2. **Image Format Optimization**: Explore format-specific optimizations
3. **Caching Strategies**: Implement better caching for optimized images
4. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling for image loading failures

## Verification

After implementing this fix:
- Product images should load correctly through Next.js image optimization
- No more 400 Bad Request errors for `_next/image` requests
- Clean, efficient configuration without duplicates
- Consistent image loading experience across all pages
