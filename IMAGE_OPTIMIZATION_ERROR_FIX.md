# Image Optimization Error Fix

## Problem Identified

The application was experiencing a 400 Bad Request error when trying to load product images through Vercel's image optimization service (`_next/image`). The error occurred because:

1. Images were being served from a Supabase domain (`sefirznxgiymfkegdtgh.supabase.co`)
2. This domain was not configured in the Next.js `remotePatterns` configuration
3. Vercel's image optimization service requires explicit domain configuration for security reasons

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)

Added the missing Supabase domain to the `remotePatterns` configuration:

```typescript
{
  protocol: 'https',
  hostname: 'sefirznxgiymfkegdtgh.supabase.co',
  port: '',
  pathname: '/storage/v1/object/public/**',
}
```

This allows Vercel's image optimization service to process images from this domain.

### 2. Enhanced ProductImage Component (`src/app/admin/products/page.tsx`)

Improved the ProductImage component with better error handling and loading states:

- Added loading spinners while images are loading
- Implemented fallback handling for failed image loads
- Used the same robust error handling pattern as in the shop pages
- Maintained consistent UI experience even when images fail to load

## Root Cause Analysis

The error was occurring because:

1. Next.js uses Vercel's image optimization service in production deployments
2. This service requires explicit configuration of allowed remote domains for security
3. The application was trying to load images from a Supabase storage bucket domain that wasn't in the configuration
4. Without proper configuration, Vercel returns a 400 Bad Request error

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Deploy the application to Vercel
2. Access the admin products page
3. Check that product images load correctly without 400 errors
4. Verify that the browser console no longer shows image optimization errors

## Future Considerations

1. **Dynamic Domain Configuration**: If the Supabase domain changes, the configuration will need to be updated
2. **Multiple Environments**: Different Supabase projects (dev/staging/prod) may have different domains
3. **Image Optimization Settings**: Consider adjusting quality and format settings for better performance

## Files Modified

1. `next.config.ts` - Added Supabase domain to remotePatterns
2. `src/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Enhanced ProductImage component

## Verification

After implementing these changes:

- Images from the Supabase storage bucket should load correctly through Vercel's image optimization service
- No more 400 Bad Request errors for `_next/image` requests
- Improved user experience with loading states and error handling
