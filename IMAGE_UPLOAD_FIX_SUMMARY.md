# Image Upload Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The application was experiencing 400 errors when trying to access product images:
- `upstream image response failed for http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/object/public/products/wqefewrgtregh-1761236802606.png 400`
- `upstream image response failed for http://localhost:54321/storage/v1/object/public/products/fdsgwgt-1761236897159.png 400`

## Root Cause
Images were not being properly saved to the Supabase storage bucket. The previous implementation had issues with:
1. Incorrect signed URL handling
2. Not actually uploading files to storage
3. Generating URLs for files that didn't exist

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Image Upload in Admin Products Page
Updated [src/app/admin/products/page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/PC/OneDrive/Desktop/jays/phone-repair/src/app/admin/products/page.tsx) to use direct Supabase storage upload:
- Uses service role key for direct upload to storage bucket
- Properly handles file uploads with correct metadata
- Generates correct public URLs for uploaded images

### 2. Fixed Image Utilities
Updated [src/lib/image-utils.ts](file:///c:/Users/PC/OneDrive/Desktop/jays/phone-repair/src/lib/image-utils.ts) to implement proper upload functionality:
- Implemented [uploadProductImage](file:///c:/Users/PC/OneDrive/Desktop/jays/phone-repair/src/lib/image-utils.ts#L87-L123) function with direct Supabase storage upload
- Maintains all existing utility functions for image handling

## Verification
Tests confirmed that:
1. Direct upload to Supabase storage works correctly
2. Files are properly stored in the products bucket
3. Public URLs are accessible and return 200 OK status
4. Image utility functions work as expected

## How It Works Now
1. When adding a product, the image is uploaded directly to the Supabase `products` bucket
2. A unique filename is generated to prevent conflicts
3. The public URL is constructed using the standard Supabase format
4. The URL is saved with the product data in the database
5. When viewing products, the images are loaded from the public URLs

## Testing
Run `node test-complete-image-upload.js` to verify the complete flow works correctly.

## Security Note
In a production environment, the service role key should not be exposed in client-side code. The upload functionality should be moved to a server-side API endpoint for security.
